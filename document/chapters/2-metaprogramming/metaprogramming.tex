\chapter{Metaprogramming in Kotlin}\label{chapter:metaprogramming}
A typical program computation can be summarized as follows: it read data as input, compute that data and generates an output. Metaprograms \cite{metaprogramming_introduction} are able to take as input another program, sometime even itself, manipulate it and return it with a modified behavior.\newline
Metaprogramming in Kotlin is a powerful feature that allows for the manipulation and generation of code at compile time. The possible benefits of this technique are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Code generation: it generates repetitive or boilerplate code automatically, reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained by hand. Consequently, this can increase code readability and maintainability, as well as reduce the risk of introducing bugs or errors;
    \item Readability: it provides a higher level of abstraction, allowing to abstract away complex logic and make code more readable and easier to understand. This can also help to simplify the implementation of complex algorithms and data structures;
    \item Reusability: by generating code automatically, it is possible reuse the same logic across multiple parts of applications, increasing overall code reuse and maintainability;
    \item Supports Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs): it enables to create custom, domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are optimized for specific tasks or use cases, which can help to simplify complex operations and make the code more readable and intuitive;
    \item Custom annotations: it allows creating custom annotations, which can be used to provide additional information about the code and to automate tasks such as code generation. This can improve code quality and make it easier to understand the intention behind the code.
\end{itemize}

\section{Metaprogramming techniques}
There are different techniques that can be used in Kotlin in order to create metaprograms. In the following sections they are going to be analyzed in details the main approaches provided by Kotlin, in order to give an overview of the possible alternatives when coming into terms with metaprogramming.

\subsection{Annotations}
Annotations \cite{annotation_documentation} in Kotlin are a type of metadata that can be added to provide additional information about the code, as well as to automate certain tasks.\newline
An annotation is represented by an \textbf{@} symbol followed by the annotation type.

For example, this is a custom annotation in Kotlin:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of custom annotation in Kotlin}, language=Kotlin, captionpos=b, label={code:kotlin_annotations_creation}]
    @Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS, AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION)
    @Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
    annotation class MyAnnotation
\end{lstlisting}
In this snippet of code, the \textbf{@Target} annotation specifies the elements that the annotation can be applied to, in this case either classes or functions. The \textbf{@Retention} annotation refers to the retention policy, which determines whether the annotation is available at runtime.

Annotations can be used to provide metadata, such as the purpose of a function, the intended usage of a class, or the preferred behavior of a method. One possible use case is to use annotations to specify that a certain method should only be called on a background thread, or that a certain class is serializable.

Another feature provided by annotations, which can be considered metaprogramming, is the possibility to used them to automate tasks, such as code generation. For example, annotations can be used to automatically generates code for serializing and deserializing objects.

To create annotations, first it is necessary to declare the annotation type, using the \textbf{annotation} keyword in Kotlin, in the same way shown in the Listing \ref{code:kotlin_annotations_creation}.\newline
Then, it is possible to use the annotation in the code by placing the \textbf{@} symbol, followed by the annotation type before the element that is going to be annotated, such as a class, function, or property.

The following snippet of code shows how to actually use a custom annotation, such as the one created in Listing \ref{code:kotlin_annotations_creation}:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of usage of a custom annotation in Kotlin}, language=Kotlin, captionpos=b, label={code:kotlin_annotations_usage}]
    @MyAnnotation
    class MyClass

    fun myFunction() {
        @MyAnnotation
        val myVariable = 42
    }
\end{lstlisting}
In this example, the \textbf{MyAnnotation} annotation is applied to both a class and a variable. The annotations can be used by other code, either at compile time or at runtime, to provide additional information about the annotated elements.
