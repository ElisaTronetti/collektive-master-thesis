\section{Manage the Bibliography}
In \textit{"document > bibliography.bib"} you can place your bib references that will be automatically added to the document's bibliography every time you cite something \cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/job.4030130102}.

Remember that often websites offering articles also allow you download a pre-made BibTex reference that can be pasted into the .bib file.
