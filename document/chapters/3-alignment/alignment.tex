\chapter{Transparent alignment in Kotlin}\label{chapter:alignment}
The alignment is a crucial feature that is necessary to solve in order to create a working implementation of the \textbf{Aggregate computing} paradigm. Different approaches have been tried to find a solution, and, in each attempt a different problem has been found. The following sections analyze all the possibilities taken in consideration: Section \ref{section:hashes_stacktraces} goes into details of the attempts with the hashes and the stacktraces, Section \ref{section_annotation_ksp} exploit the problem with annotations and KSP, understanding their limits. Finally, Section \ref{section:compiler_plugin_solution} describes in details the solution adopted.
